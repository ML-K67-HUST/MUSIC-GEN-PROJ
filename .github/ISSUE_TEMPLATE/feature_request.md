**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**

I'm always frustrated when I try to classify a song from a streaming service, and I have to download the song first before I can upload it to the classifier. This extra step is inconvenient and time-consuming.

**Describe the solution you'd like**

I would like the classifier to accept URLs from popular streaming services (like Spotify, YouTube, or SoundCloud) and be able to directly analyze the music from these links without requiring a local download. This would streamline the process and make the tool more user-friendly.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**

An alternative solution could be to provide a browser extension that allows users to classify music directly while browsing streaming services. Another possibility is a desktop application that integrates with streaming services to automatically classify currently playing tracks.

**Additional context**

It would be helpful if the feature could support batch processing, allowing users to input a playlist URL and get classifications for all the songs in the playlist. This would be particularly useful for users who want to organize large music libraries or create genre-specific playlists.
