## Overview
We dedicated to develop an AI agent capable of classifying music into ten distinct genres with a high level
of confidence. By leveraging machine learning, deep learning, and ensemble learning techniques, we aim 
to create a robust and effective music classifier.

## Project detail
### Project timeline 
- Duration: April 2024 to July 2024
### Key features
- Machine Learning Techniques: Implementing a range of machine learning, deep learning, and ensemble learning techniques to enhance classification accuracy.
- Custom Dataset: Creating our own dataset through web scraping, improving upon the existing GTZAN dataset to ensure comprehensive and diverse data.
- Model Evaluation: Thoroughly evaluating our models and employing strategies to avoid overfitting, ensuring the production of the most effective classifier.
- Deployment: Packaging our solution into a Docker image, deployed via Fly.io, making it accessible online for public use.
